⚠️ VLC Folder Not Included

Due to size limits, the VLC runtime folder is not included in this repository.

To run the Quran App with audio:
1. Install VLC (64-bit) from: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
2. Copy the "VLC" installation folder from:
   C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC
   → into this project folder (next to Quran App.py)
3. The structure should look like:

   QuranApp/
   ├── Quran App.py
   ├── quran.ico
   ├── VLC/
   │   ├── libvlc.dll
   │   ├── libvlccore.dll
   │   └── plugins/
   └── resources/

Basically download it ideally 64 bit version and add the folder here.
